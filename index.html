                        <p>The most obvious answer would be because they are registered with that DMV. Aside from that the cost is lower, you are not required to have a business presence in the Pine Tree State, and the state of Maine only requires a federal dot inspection.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>It is cheaper to register trucks in Indiana and Tennesse. Another reason for Tennesse is that the primary hub of FedEx is in Memphis.</p>

                        <p>The headquarters of Uhaul is in Arizona and so most of their vehicles are registered with the DMV of Arizona.</p>

                        <h1>Why most trucks have one license plate on the cab and another one on the trailer:</h3>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>The most obvious answer is that a semi is technically two different vehicles so they each have their own license plate. Another reason is the old bingo stamp program. One license plate is real while the other is not. Trucking businesses that operate out of more than one state have to collect stickers that are given out by government transport agencies. In order to not lose those stcikers truckers place them on a seperate sheet of metal. This seperate sheet of metal with all of the stickers ends up looking like a seperate license plate.</p>
